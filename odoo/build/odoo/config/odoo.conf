; This is a modified odoo.conf file adapted for local Odoo development.
; Some sane defaults have been chosen to make your life a little easier.
; You can edit this file locally to suit your needs if necessary.
; After editing, you must rebuild your local Odoo Docker image.

; Helpful gist that explains all config options:
; https://gist.github.com/Guidoom/d5db0a76ce669b139271a528a8a2a27f



; This configuration does not provide an admin password by default,
; so you can just tinker with your local instance right away.
; You can obviously still provide one if you'd like.

; Logging is set to DEBUG for everything by default.
;
; You can optionally only enable certain log levels for certain modules, e.g.:
; log_handler = ['path.to.your.module:DEBUG', 'werkzeug:DEBUG']

; The other logging configuration values have been excluded in this file,
; but you can of course still add them if necessary.
